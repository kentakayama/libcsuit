# [libcsuit](https://github.com/kentakayama/libcsuit/)
**libcsuit** is a C library for encoding and decoding [IETF SUIT manifests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-suit-manifest).
The manifest contains meta-data about the firmware image. The manifest is protected against modification and provides information
about the software/firmware author.

For more information on how the IETF SUIT manifest is used to protect firmware updates of IoT devices, please look at the
 [IETF SUIT architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9019) document and the
 [IETF SUIT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/suit/about/) working group.

Supported features are listed [SUPPORTED.md](./SUPPORTED.md).

## Overview

This implementation uses
 - the [QCBOR](https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR) library for encoding and decoding CBOR structures,
 - the [t_cose](https://github.com/laurencelundblade/t_cose) library for cryptographic processing of COSE structures,
 - OpenSSL or Mbed TLS (based on the PSA Crypto API) for cryptographic algorithms.

This implementation offers the functionality defined in
- [draft-ietf-suit-manifest-22](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-suit-manifest-22)
- [draft-ietf-suit-trust-domains-03](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-suit-trust-domains-03)
- [draft-ietf-suit-update-management-02](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-suit-update-management-02)
- [draft-ietf-suit-firmware-encryption-12](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-suit-firmware-encryption-12)
- ~~[draft-ietf-suit-mud-03](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-suit-mud-03)~~
- ~~[draft-ietf-suit-report-05](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-suit-report-05)~~

Example programs are offered for testing.

## Getting started
We recommend you to execute examples with docker
because it may install some files into your file system
depends on the input SUIT Manifest.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kentakayama/libcsuit
cd ./libcsuit
```

**(a) Use OpenSSL**
```
docker build -t libcsuit_ossl -f ossl.Dockerfile .
docker run -t libcsuit_ossl ./bin/suit_manifest_process ./testfiles/suit_maniefst_expS1.cbor
```

**(b) Use Mbed TLS**
```
docker build -t libcsuit_psa -f psa.Dockerfile .
docker run -t libcsuit_psa ./bin/suit_manifest_process ./testfiles/suit_maniefst_expS1.cbor
```

**(c) Use OpenSSL 3**
```
docker build -t libcsuit_ossl3 -f ossl3.Dockerfile .
docker run -t libcsuit_ossl3 ./bin/suit_manifest_process ./testfiles/suit_maniefst_expS1.cbor
```
